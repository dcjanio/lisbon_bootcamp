# Week 3 Challenge - Working Status

## What's Working

1. **Contract Publication**: 
   - The SIX token contract is successfully published to the Sui devnet
   - The contract ID and shared object IDs are stored in `ids.ts`

2. **PTB Implementation**:
   - Mint SIX tokens function is implemented and working
   - Stake SIX tokens function is implemented and working
   - Combined mint and stake in one PTB is implemented
   - Function to get the first SUI coin ID is working
   - Function to split a coin into 4 equal parts works and calculates storage rebate
   - Function to merge coins works and provides gas analysis
   - Function to exchange SUI for SIX, unstake, and get rewards is implemented

3. **Test Environment**:
   - Basic testing setup with a run script is working

## What's Needed

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - More extensive tests for edge cases
   - Better error handling for network issues

2. **Documentation**:
   - More detailed documentation for each function
   - Better explanation of gas costs and storage rebate analysis

3. **UI Integration**:
   - A simple frontend to interact with the contract functions

## Next Steps

1. Write more tests for the PTB implementations
2. Add better error handling for network errors
3. Improve documentation with examples
4. Create a simple UI for interacting with the contract
